# Wtapp.ga
Built with Vue, PWA.

It is so stupid that I have to add a new person every time to phone book because I want to send a WhatsApp message to him/her. 

That's why I make this simple progressive web application. It allows you to send a WhatsApp message to a person without adding him/her to the phone book.

## Demo
- [Wtapp.ga](https://wtapp.ga)
