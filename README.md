## Live Demo
- [Add9u.com](https://add9u.com)

It is a progressive web application. Just directly add it to your home screen if you have an Android device.

Want a quicker way? You can directly add the phone number with country code after `https://add9u.com/whatsapp/`.

Take a phone number `94340634` with country code `+852` as an example:
```
https://add9u.com/whatsapp/85294340634
```
